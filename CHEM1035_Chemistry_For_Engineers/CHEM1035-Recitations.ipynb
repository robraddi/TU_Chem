This is achieved by ionizing the compund into fragments, propelling them along a free path inside a vacuum, varying the electric and magnetic fields as particles hit a detector.

    "#### The overall objective of this chapter is to understand macroscopic properties such as temperature and pressure on a microscopic level.\n",

    "### State the postulates of kinetic theory of gases:\n",

    "1) A gas is made up of a vast number of particles, and these particles are in ceaseless random motion.\n",

    "$$ \\text{As } V \\uparrow \\text{, the walls move farther apart and frequency of particles hitting the wall } \\downarrow $$\n",

    "2) Particles in a gas are infinitely small; they occupy no volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Particles in a gas move in straight lines except when they collide with other molecules or with walls of the container. Collisions with each other and with the walls of the container are elastic, so that the total kinetic energy of the particles is conserved.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Particles in a gas interact with each other only when collisions occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The average kinetic energy, $<K.E>$ of the particles in a gas is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas and does not depend on the identity of the gas.\n",
