This is achieved by ionizing the compund into fragments, propelling them along a free path inside a vacuum, varying the electric and magnetic fields as particles hit a detector. Using only a tiny amount of a chemical compound one can obtain a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio.\n",
