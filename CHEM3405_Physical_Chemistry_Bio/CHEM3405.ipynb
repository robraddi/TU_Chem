    "\n",
    "In class, we have been discussing wavefunction solutions $\\psi(x)$ to Schrödinger’s Equation, $H\\psi = E\\psi$, for an electron as a function of its position $x$. Computational chemistry programs approximate solutions to Schrödinger Equation, but for multi-electron systems—atoms and molecules:\n",

    "$$\\hat{H}\\psi(x_{1}, x_{2},…x_{n}) = E\\psi(x_{1}, x_{2},…x_{n}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that if you assume the electrons do not interact (i.e. do not feel each others’ repulsion), then the wave function is separable, i.e. solutions are products of one-electron wavefunctions $\\psi(x_{1}, x_{2},…x_{n}) = \\psi_{1}(x_{1}) \\psi_{2}(x_{2})… \\psi_{n}(x_{n})$. The $\\psi_{i}$ are called *orbitals*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum chemistry methods try to solve for $\\psi$ as a product of orbitals, with different ways of approximating the effects of electron interaction. The computed solution is a set of *molecular orbitals* (MOs), each a one-electron wavefunction that can be spread out over the entire molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might imagine, MOs are complicated entities, but can be represented as a *superposition* (i.e. a sum) of *atomic orbitals* (AOs), i.e. wavefunctions of electrons bound to a specific nucleus. For reasons of computational efficiency, each AO in turn is (usually) represented by superposition of simpler functions called *basis functions*. The more basis functions you use, the better the approximation, but at increased computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will explore the effects of using different *basis sets* (i.e. groups of basis functions) for an atomic orbital calculation. We will consider three different basis sets, STO-3G, 3-21G, and 6-31G\\* (Figure 1).\n",
