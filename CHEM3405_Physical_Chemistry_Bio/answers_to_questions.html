<p>Consider <strong>Table 1</strong> from Kussie et al. (1996), in which statistics are given for a number of similar crystal structures the authors obtained.</p>

<p>The <em>R</em>-factor is a measure of the quality of the (electron density) model, defined as <em>R</em> = Σ|<em>F</em><sub>o</sub> - <em>F</em><sub>c</sub>|/ Σ|<em>F</em><sub>o</sub>|, where <em>F</em><sub>o</sub> and <em>F</em><sub>c</sub> are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. Because of the iterative refinement of computed structure factors from the observed data, there is a danger of overfitting. A more useful measure is called the <em>R</em><sub>free</sub> value, where 10% of the observed structure factors are left out of the data set, so they can be used for testing the predictions.</p>

<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>
<p>Which should have the larger value, <em>R</em> or <em>R</em><sub>free</sub>?</p>

<p>Recall that the crystallographic B-factor reports how diffuse the model of electronic density is for each atom. It is highly correlated to thermal motion. In Chimera, color the protein by B-factor, using <strong>Actions</strong> &gt; <strong>Color</strong> &gt; <strong>all options…</strong> &gt; <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Render by Attribute</strong> (choose bfactor in the pull-down menu for Attribute:, then click Apply)</p>
<p>7. What parts of the protein have the most thermal motion?</p>
<p><strong>NMR structure of <em>apo-</em>MDM2</strong></p>
<p><strong>PDB</strong>: The atomic coordinates for this structure are deposited in the Protein Data Bank</p>
<p>under PDB ID: <strong>1Z1M</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Publication</strong>: Uhrinova, S., Uhrin, D., Powers, H., Watt, K., Zheleva, D., Fischer, P., et al. (2005). Structure of Free MDM2 N-terminal Domain Reveals Conformational Adjustments that Accompany p53-binding. <em>Journal of Molecular Biology</em>, <em>350</em> (3), 587– 598. doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2005.05.010</p>
<p>Solution structures of proteins are usually determined using 2D NMR spectroscopy. Two-dimensional techniques measure how the magnetization of one kind of nuclei (say, <sup>1</sup>H) is affected by another kind of nuclei (say, <sup>15</sup>N). The first step in 2D NMR is to <em>assign</em> the various magnetic resonances to particular protons. As long as the spectroscopic peaks are disperse (i.e. well-defined and far enough apart to be distinguished from one another), assignment is possible because resonance can only occur for nearby (through-bond) nuclei. For example, Figure 1 in</p>
<p>Uhrinova et al. (2005) shows HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) spectra disperse enough to assign (a) backbone NH protons and (b) side-chain protons.</p>

<p>Once the peaks are assigned, studies of NMR relaxation times can determine the presence of Nuclear Overhauser Effects, or <strong>NOEs</strong>. An NOE is a short-range transfer of nuclear spin polarization from one nuclei to another that occurs through <em>space</em> (rather than through-bond). Like its optical cousin FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer), it is an induced-dipole-dipole interaction that falls off as ~1/<em>r</em><sup>6</sup>. If an NOE is observed between two protons, it means that they must be close in three-dimensional space, with the strength of the NOE related to proximity, for example:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Strong NOEs: 1.7 Å to 2.5 Å</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium strong NOEs: 2.5 Å to 3.5 Å</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium weak NOEs: 3.5 Å to 4.5 Å</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weak NOEs: 4.5 Å to 5.5 Å</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>A set of measured NOE distances can put enough restraints on the set of possible protein structures, so as to completely determine the solution conformation. A computer is used to explore possible structures that best satisfy the NOE distance restraints, generating an <em>ensemble</em> of different conformations, each equally compatible with the experimental restraints.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>In Chimera, load structure <strong>1Z1M</strong>.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Why does this structure include protons, whereas the X-ray crystal structure does not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are there so many structures in this PDB?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously, there are very few NOE distance restraints for the N-terminal region. The modeled ensemble has many possible conformations for this region. How well do you think this represents reality? In other words: how much is the conformational heterogeneity an artifact of the computer models used for structural refinement, versus a real feature of the MDM2 N-terminal region? Can you think of any other experimental biophysical methods that you could use to answer this question?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus: Load both the X-ray structure (1YCR) and the NMR structure (1Z1M) into Chimera and align them using <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Structure Comparison</strong> &gt; <strong>MatchMaker</strong> (select 1YCR as the reference, and shift-click to select all NMR structures to match).</p>
<p>4. Can you see any changes in the binding cleft as described by Uhrinova et al.?</p>
