<p><strong>Computer Lab – Chimera 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography vs. nuclear magnetic resonance methods.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In this exercise, we will use a protein called MDM2 as an example. MDM2 is an important protein in cancer—it has the ability to bind the transactivation domain of tumor suppressor protein p53, downregulating its ability to activate transcription. Many researchers have sought to develop anti-cancer drugs that target the binding site of MDM2, blocking p53 from binding, and thus upregulating the tumor suppressor activity of p53. Several of these drugs are currently in clinical trials.<a href="#fn_Cornell" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref_Cornell"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The first high-resolution atomic structure of MDM2 bound to p53 came from an X-ray crystal structure by Kussie et al. (1996).<a href="#fn_Hoe" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref_Hoe"><sup>2</sup></a> This structure shows a small helical region of p53 that binds a hydrophobic cleft in MDM2. To get these proteins to co-crystallize well, constructs with only residues 17-125 of MDM2, and residues 15-29 of p53, were used. Only the atomic structures of residues 25-109 could be resolved, however.</p>

<p><strong>X-ray crystal structure of MDM2-p53</strong></p>
<p><strong>PDB</strong>: The atomic coordinates for this structure are deposited in the Protein Data Bank</p>
<p>under PDB ID: <strong>1YCR</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Publication</strong>: Kussie, P. H., Gorina, S., Marechal, V., Elenbaas, B., Moreau, J., Levine, A. J., &amp; Pavletich, N. P. (1996). Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. <em>Science</em>, <em>274</em>(5289), 948–953.</p>
<p>Last week we learned about X-ray crystallography, and how it can be used to determine the atomic structure of proteins. Recall that this involves: (1) collecting diffraction data (i.e. the intensities of a large number of diffraction spots and their identification with Miller indices and a unit cell), and (2) using a model of protein electron density to calculate (by Fourier Transform) computed structure factors <em>F</em><sub>c</sub> that can be compared to the observed structure factors |<em>F</em><sub>o</sub>|.<a href="#fn_Uhrinova" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref_Uhrinova"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The resolution of the computed electron density depends on the number of diffraction spots (i.e. the number of “reflections”). To give you some sense of the resolution of the final model, consider Figure 1 from Kussie et al (1996) below:</p>

<img src="images/electron_density_map.png" align="center" width="600" height="600">

<p><b>Figure.</b> MIR electron density map of the X. laevis MDM2-p53 interface at 3.0 A resolution, contoured at 1.0 a, with the refined 2.3 A resolution atomic model in a stick representation. Stereo view focuses on the interactions of Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26 of p53 (labeled) with the (x2 helix of MDM2.</p>
<p>As you can see, the final model of the electron density really is “blobby”, but it is high-resolution enough that backbone and side-chain atoms (solid black lines, hard to see, I know) can be fit unambiguously. Some regions of this density may be too diffuse to fit (often the thermally mobile termini). For these regions, the protein structure is typically left undefined (hence, “missing residues” are common in X-ray crystal structures.)</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Consider <strong>Table 1</strong> from Kussie et al. (1996), in which statistics are given for a number of similar crystal structures the authors obtained.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Why is the number of unique reflections smaller than the total number?</p>

<p>The <em>R</em>-factor is a measure of the quality of the (electron density) model, defined as <em>R</em> = Σ|<em>F</em><sub>o</sub> - <em>F</em><sub>c</sub>|/ Σ|<em>F</em><sub>o</sub>|, where <em>F</em><sub>o</sub> and <em>F</em><sub>c</sub> are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. Because of the iterative refinement of computed structure factors from the observed data, there is a danger of overfitting. A more useful measure is called the <em>R</em><sub>free</sub> value, where 10% of the observed structure factors are left out of the data set, so they can be used for testing the predictions.</p>

<li>
<p>Which should have the larger value, <em>R</em> or <em>R</em><sub>free</sub>?</p>

<p><strong>NMR structure of <em>apo-</em>MDM2</strong></p>
<p><strong>PDB</strong>: The atomic coordinates for this structure are deposited in the Protein Data Bank</p>
<p>under PDB ID: <strong>1Z1M</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Publication</strong>: Uhrinova, S., Uhrin, D., Powers, H., Watt, K., Zheleva, D., Fischer, P., et al. (2005). Structure of Free MDM2 N-terminal Domain Reveals Conformational Adjustments that Accompany p53-binding. <em>Journal of Molecular Biology</em>, <em>350</em> (3), 587– 598. doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2005.05.010</p>
<p>Solution structures of proteins are usually determined using 2D NMR spectroscopy. Two-dimensional techniques measure how the magnetization of one kind of nuclei (say, <sup>1</sup>H) is affected by another kind of nuclei (say, <sup>15</sup>N). The first step in 2D NMR is to <em>assign</em> the various magnetic resonances to particular protons. As long as the spectroscopic peaks are disperse (i.e. well-defined and far enough apart to be distinguished from one another), assignment is possible because resonance can only occur for nearby (through-bond) nuclei. For example, Figure 1 in</p>
<p>Uhrinova et al. (2005) shows HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) spectra disperse enough to assign (a) backbone NH protons and (b) side-chain protons.</p>

Folded peaks are shown in grey. <sup>H</sup>N–<sup>N</sup>H assignments are indicated by residue number. (b) A portion of the <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C HSQC spectrum showing methyl groups, with assignments indicated by residue and atom identifier (based on CNS notation).</p>


<!-- Page 4 -->
<p>Once the peaks are assigned, studies of NMR relaxation times can determine the presence of Nuclear Overhauser Effects, or <strong>NOEs</strong>. An NOE is a short-range transfer of nuclear spin polarization from one nuclei to another that occurs through <em>space</em> (rather than through-bond). Like its optical cousin FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer), it is an induced-dipole-dipole interaction that falls off as ~1/<em>r</em><sup>6</sup>. If an NOE is observed between two protons, it means that they must be close in three-dimensional space, with the strength of the NOE related to proximity, for example:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Strong NOEs: 1.7 Å to 2.5 Å</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium strong NOEs: 2.5 Å to 3.5 Å</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium weak NOEs: 3.5 Å to 4.5 Å</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weak NOEs: 4.5 Å to 5.5 Å</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>A set of measured NOE distances can put enough restraints on the set of possible protein structures, so as to completely determine the solution conformation. A computer is used to explore possible structures that best satisfy the NOE distance restraints, generating an <em>ensemble</em> of different conformations, each equally compatible with the experimental restraints.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>In Chimera, load structure <strong>1Z1M</strong>.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Why does this structure include protons, whereas the X-ray crystal structure does not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are there so many structures in this PDB?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously, there are very few NOE distance restraints for the N-terminal region. The modeled ensemble has many possible conformations for this region. How well do you think this represents reality? In other words: how much is the conformational heterogeneity an artifact of the computer models used for structural refinement, versus a real feature of the MDM2 N-terminal region? Can you think of any other experimental biophysical methods that you could use to answer this question?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus: Load both the X-ray structure (1YCR) and the NMR structure (1Z1M) into Chimera and align them using <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Structure Comparison</strong> &gt; <strong>MatchMaker</strong> (select 1YCR as the reference, and shift-click to select all NMR structures to match).</p>
<p>4. Can you see any changes in the binding cleft as described by Uhrinova et al.?</p>
