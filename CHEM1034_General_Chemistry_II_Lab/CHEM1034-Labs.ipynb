    "Acetylsalicylic acid (main component of Asprin) is actually derived from the Voodoo Lilly. Salicylic acid is a plant hormone that triggers the Voodoo Lilly to emit a foul odor that attracts flies.  The fly gets trapped inside the flower for a full day.  During this time, the fly gets covered in pollen.  The next morning it is released, where it then goes to another Voodoo Lilly to deposit the pollen. \n",
