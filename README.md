# TU_Chem - is a repo for compiling teaching resources for recitation and lab at Temple University. [Notebooks can be rendered here](https://robraddi.github.io/teaching.html).

Note: This collection of notebooks, quizzes, practice exams, etc. that I have put together for assisting the teaching of undergraduate chemistry courses at Temple University. These are not for profit and strictly for teaching purposes. Although, the bulk of work is my own labor, a substantial amount of material inside these notebooks has been compiled from various textbooks and internet sources. I thank all who have contributed.
