## Viewing the notebooks:

• [NBViewer - robraddi/TU_Chem](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/robraddi/TU_Chem/tree/master/) — a website that renders Jupyter notebooks very well.

• [My website](https://sites.google.com/a/temple.edu/robertraddi/teaching) — pages with NBViewer embeded

## Disclaimer:
This repository (**not for profit**) is **strictly for teaching** and contains a collection of notes, quizzes, practice exams, etc. that I have put together for assisting the teaching of undergraduate chemistry courses at Temple University. 
Although, the bulk of work is my own labor, a substantial amount of material inside these notebooks has been compiled from various textbooks and internet sources. I thank all who have aided me in this process.
