This repository (**not for profit**) is **strictly for teaching** and contains a collection of notes, quizzes, practice exams, etc. that I have put together for assisting the teaching of undergraduate chemistry courses at Temple University. 
Although, the bulk of work is my own labor, a substantial amount of material inside these notebooks has been compiled from various textbooks and internet sources. I thank all who have aided me in this process.
